## Description: ðŸ“˜ REAL-TIME-CHAT-APPLICATION USING WEBSOCKETS

Design and implement a real-time chat application using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Socket.IO for the backend. The goal is to establish live two-way communication between multiple users.

## Technologies Used:

Frontend: React.js, CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO

Tools: npm, Webpack, VS Code, browser dev tools

Key Features:

Real-time message exchange using WebSockets

User-friendly UI with message input and display area

Dynamic message rendering with sender identification

Responsive design with basic styling

Basic server setup with Express and Socket.IO integration

Implementation Details:

Frontend (React):

Built UI components in ChatApp.js.

Managed message state using Reactâ€™s useState.

Used socket.io-client to connect with the backend WebSocket.

Styled the interface using a custom CSS file (ChatApp.css) with optional background.

Backend (Node.js + Socket.IO):

Created a server using Express and HTTP modules.

Initialized WebSocket connections using Socket.IO.

Handled message broadcast events (chat message) and user connection logs.

## Running the App:

Two servers: one for the frontend (localhost:3000) and one for the backend (localhost:5001).

Ensured CORS configuration for frontend-backend communication.

Challenges Faced:

Path issues with background images

Webpack compilation errors

Simultaneously running both frontend and backend servers

## OUTPUT:
Successfully built a functional real-time chat application that allows multiple users to send and receive messages instantly.
